The aim of this internship is to explore the impact of machine learning techniques on job-candidate matching. Based on a sample of data containing both job offers and users, I will implement various learning algorithms to assess their quality. In a second phase, the work is extended by searching a system of vigilance against biases (gender, geography...) with a view to ensuring fairness between candidates.
